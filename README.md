# Simple Calculator Application

This project is a basic calculator application built using Python's Tkinter library. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- User-friendly interface with buttons for numbers and arithmetic operations.
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Displays input expressions and results dynamically.
- Includes a clear button to reset the input.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure Python (3.x) is installed on your system.
3. Run the `calculator.py` file to launch the application:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```
4. Use the on-screen buttons to input numbers and operations:
   - Click on numbers (0-9) and operators (+, -, *, /) to build an expression.
   - Press the `=` button to calculate the result.
   - Press the `Clear` button to reset the input field.

## Code Overview

The application is implemented using the following components:

- **Tkinter GUI Components**:
  - `Entry`: Displays the current expression or result.
  - `Button`: Represents each digit (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), and actions (`Clear`, `=`).

- **Core Functions**:
  - `press(num)`: Appends the clicked number/operator to the expression.
  - `clear()`: Clears the current expression.
  - `equalpress()`: Evaluates the expression and displays the result.

## Dependencies

The application requires no external dependencies other than Python's standard library.

## File Structure

- `calculator.py`: The main Python script containing the calculator application code.

## Example

To calculate `5 + 3`:
1. Click `5`.
2. Click `+`.
3. Click `3`.
4. Click `=` to display the result (`8`).
